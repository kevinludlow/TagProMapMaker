An HTML/JS map maker for the popular internet capture the flag game, TagPro

Since this is only just being released to the community I am still in the process of building the readme.  Please feel free to contribute as you see fit.

# Requirements

## Linux Machine
## PHP
## MySQL Database
## ImageMagick (http://www.imagemagick.org/script/install-source.php)

# Setup

## Create a database called TagProMapMaker
## Run the SQL script found in /config/TagProMapMaker.sql (this will automatically create a test user)
## Edit config/config.php

# Important

## Once you have configured your config.php file be sure to add it to your .gitignore file.  We do not want people checking in their private security keys.
